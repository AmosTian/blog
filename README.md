👋Hi there !

🌱My name is Amos Tian, a computer science student.

In the future, I will continue to learn the following
- ⚡Programming Language: C++, Java, Python
- ⚡Development Technology: Database，some middleware (redis and so on)
- ⚡Algorithm: some theory and practice questions
- ⚡Machine Learning: some theoretical and implementation of practice models
- ⚡Some strange tricks: such as how to build a blog, how to crack software, etc.

😄Right now I'm learning: C++ and AI.
