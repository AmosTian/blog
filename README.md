ðŸ‘‹Hi there !

ðŸŒ±My name is Amos Tian, a computer science student.

This repository is a remote repository for storing my personal blog âœ¨https://amostian.github.ioâœ¨. This blog contains a lot of study notes recorded in markdown format.

In the future, I will continue to learn the following
- âš¡Programming Language: C++, Java, Python
- âš¡Development Technology: Databaseï¼Œsome middleware (redis and so on)
- âš¡Algorithm: some theory and practice questions
- âš¡Machine Learning: some theoretical and implementation of practice models
- âš¡Some strange tricks: such as how to build a blog, how to crack software, etc.

ðŸ˜„Right now I'm learning: C++ and databases.
